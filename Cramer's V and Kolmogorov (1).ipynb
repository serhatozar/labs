    "\n",
    "1. Manufacturer: The brand or manufacturer of the car.\n",
    "2. Model: The specific model name of the car.\n",
    "3. Location: The location where the car is being sold.\n",
    "4. Year: The manufacturing year of the car.\n",
    "5. Kilometers_Driven: The total distance driven by the car in kilometers.\n",
    "6. Fuel_Type: The type of fuel used by the car (Petrol, Diesel, CNG, LPG, Electric).\n",
    "7. Transmission: The type of transmission system in the car (Manual, Automatic).\n",
    "8. Owner_Type: The number of previous owners of the car (First, Second, Third, Fourth & Above).\n",
    "9. Mileage: The fuel efficiency of the car in kilometers per liter.\n",
    "10. Engine: The engine displacement of the car in cubic centimeters (cc).\n",
    "11. Power: The maximum power output of the car's engine in bhp (brake horsepower).\n",
    "12. Seats: The number of seats available in the car.\n",
    "13. Price: The price of the car in Indian Rupees (INR).\n",
    "\n",
    "*The dataset is often used for regression analysis and machine learning tasks to develop predictive models for car price estimation. By analyzing the relationships between the car's features and its price, valuable insights can be gained for pricing strategies, market analysis, and decision-making in the automotive industry.*\n",
